# Welcome to Excellent Academy
1. LEARNING GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
2. Concise, specific, and well defined learning goals and objectives.  These help instructors to teach more effectively, and help students to better navigate the course.  Learning goals and objectives allow instructions to more clearly “map” the course and focus priorities in content, materials, and assignments.  This, in turn, enables students to make informed decisions about how to work with the materials, activities and assessments, and forums—perhaps in an unfamiliar medium, subject, or cultural context—to get the most out of the course.
3. Effective communication.  Students likely might not know what to expect or how to succeed in a massive open online course or in a specific discipline.  Effective communication between instructor and students—to clarify priorities and expectations, to articulate goals and objectives, as well as to define structure and instruction—is essential to efficient, effective teaching and learning in the online context.
4. Excellent Academy aim to bridge scaling gap with machine learning models via Coursera specialization.
5. The specialization course gives an overview of the moving parts (MLOps, DevOps) required to move models into production as well as topics covering accuracy, costs and optimization as prototypes scale.
